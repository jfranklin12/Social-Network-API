  ## Description
  
  Social Network API is an API social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The database, models, and routes have been created to make this application back-end functional.

  A few examples of testing routes in insomnia.
